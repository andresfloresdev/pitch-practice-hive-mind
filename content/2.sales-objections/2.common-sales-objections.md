The price objection is perhaps the most common objection encountered by salespeople. It occurs when a potential client expresses concerns about the cost of your product or service.

When facing a price objection, it's essential to reframe the conversation around value. Highlight the benefits and ROI (Return on Investment) your offering provides. Offer alternative pricing options or payment plans to make it more accessible.

## Timing Objection

Timing objections arise when a client is not ready to make a purchase or needs more time to consider their decision.

Address timing objections by understanding the client's reasons for delay. Create a sense of urgency with limited-time offers or benefits tied to immediate action. Always set a follow-up date to keep the conversation alive.
